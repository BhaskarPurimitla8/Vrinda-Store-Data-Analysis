   B2B customers account for a significant share of revenue. This segment offers opportunities for growth through corporate partnerships or exclusive bulk discounts.

3. **Order Status Analysis:**  
   A noticeable percentage of orders are returned, refunded, or canceled. This indicates possible issues with product quality, delivery, or customer expectations.
